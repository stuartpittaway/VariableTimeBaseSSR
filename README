Burst Fire Variable Time Base SSR controller (for Arduino)


Note that this code ignores the zero cross delay/miss fire of the SSR !!!

A SSR power controller with a "variable time base" changes the time base according to the power requirement. Burst ?ring with a variable time base usesthe
smallest possible number of AC cycles to deliver the required percentage power to the heater. 


Why is variable time base preferred over a ?xed time base? 
The ON/ OFF switching of the heater happens much more quickly with variable time base. The more quickly the heater is switched, the less temperature variations 
the resistance element has. The nearly constant load current to the heater keeps the heater’s resistance element temperature nearly constant. 
This provides a longer heater life.
